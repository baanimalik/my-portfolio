<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Engineering graduate who love to build using technology.I believe on learning everyday from surroundings.
During my Engineering journey i have learnt many things like operating system,object oriented programming language,
database management system,languages like c++,java,python. Currently started learning web development which i am finding very interesting.
I also like to DSA problems , i have purchased a course of DSA too and i practice daily as many questions possible .
</p>

<p>My hobbies are reading articles and blogs about latest technology in the market. I love long walks it refreshes me
i love to sing,listen songs. I like to play sports and doing activities which gives me new experiences.
Everyone has childhood dreams my dream was to become engineeer since from childhood and i am very fortunate
i am able to achieve my dream and my parents supported me very well. I always wanted to create things, now also i try to learn in order to create.

<p>My ma wants me to do something big. My life has not been very good. I have faced many problems but i am not complaining .
Actually i am grateful for them because of them only i have become a strong person.But one regret i should have achieved my dreams till now
as i have worked so hard since my childhood (also my mother is eagerly waiting for my success). I was the one obedient kind of kid everyone's favorite
in my childhood.My mother is really proud of me.
She has faith on me. I have faith on her faith. I will try my best to fulfill all her dreams, i love my career as much i love my mother.
Engineering is not only my career it is my first love,nothing makes me more happy than solving problems.
As i told my luck was not in my favor i guess, so only even after trying so hard in finding the path i couldn't get it.
I got no guidance from anyone even after searching for it so hard. This is the regret i have but it's fine. Now i got my path
I will create my own path to chase my own dreams, now destiny has to bow in front of my hard work,in front of my dreams,in front of me. 
One day i know my hard work will pay off and i will get what me and my family always dreamt off.
Now also i am ready to work hard as much as possible ,more than i can and i have been doing it since years.
I got the direction,i got the path and it's a promise to myself i will keep on doing,i will keep on going till 
my dreams got achieved.I got a new perspection ,a new way of thinking and no one and nothing can stop me now.
yeah ups and downs come,so i may slow down but will not stop.NEVER.
